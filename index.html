              I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
              knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, I
              was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master
              the soft skills required for being a software developer. <br><br> So far so
              good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my
              career as a software developer.

              Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
              in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
              different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
              fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
              presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program. <br><br>
              Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.
